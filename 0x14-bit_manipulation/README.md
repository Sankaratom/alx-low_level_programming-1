2. **1-print_binary.c** - prints an unsigned integer as a binary string
3. **2-get_bit.c** - gets the bit of an unsigned long at a given index
4. **3-set_bit.c** - sets the bit of an unsigned long at a given index to 1
5. **4-clear_bit.c** - sets the bit of an unsigned long at a given index to 0
6. **5-flip_bits.c** - gets the number of bits needed to be fliped for 2 integers to be the same
7. **100-get_endianness.c** - gets the endianness of the machine
